QuantumDNA: A Toolbox for Evaluating Excited States and Charge Transfer in DNA
==============================================================================

Welcome to **QuantumDNA** -- a comprehensive tool for performing quantum mechanical calculations on DNA.
QuantumDNA leverages the formalism of open quantum systems, utilizing tight-binding Hamiltonians to model DNA at a quantum level.
This tool can handle a variety of tight-binding models and allows users to input custom parameters derived from *ab initio* calculations or experimental data.
Furthermore, QuantumDNA enables users to define unique models, making it highly adaptable to a wide range of research needs.

Designed with accessibility in mind, QuantumDNA includes a user-friendly interface to make quantum calculations accessible to researchers of all technical backgrounds.

Some of the core functionalities of QuantumDNA include the calculation of exciton lifetimes, average charge separation, and dipole moments for excited states along DNA strands :cite:`Herb2024`.
