## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, make sure the following prerequisites are met:

1. **Python Installation**:
   - Verify that Python is installed by running:

     ```bash
     python --version
     ```

   - If Python is not installed, download and install it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Linux/macOS Users**:
   - Ensure `pip` and `tkinter` are installed:

     ```bash
     python3 -m pip --version
     python3 -m tkinter
     ```

   - If they are not installed, install them using your package manager:
     - **Debian/Ubuntu**:

       ```bash
       sudo apt install python3-pip python3-tk
       ```

     - **Fedora**:

       ```bash
       sudo dnf install python3-pip python3-tkinter
       ```

3. **Windows Users**:
   - Ensure Git is installed by running:

     ```bash
     git --version
     ```

   - If Git is not installed, download and install it from [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/).

## Installation via PyPI

The easiest way to install `qDNA` is through PyPI. For best results, we recommend creating a new virtual environment to avoid package conflicts.

### Steps

1. **Create a New Virtual Environment**:

    Open your terminal and navigate to your project folder. Run:

    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    ```

2. **Activate the Virtual Environment**:
    - **Windows**:

      ```bash
      .venv\Scripts\activate
      ```

    - **macOS/Linux**:

      ```bash
      source .venv/bin/activate
      ```

3. **Install the `qDNA` Package**:

    ```bash
    pip install qDNA
    ```

4. **Optional: Use `qDNA` Inside a Jupyter Notebook**:
    Install Jupyter and launch the notebook:

    ```bash
    pip install ipykernel notebook
    jupyter notebook
    ```

## Installation via Cloning the GitHub Repository

If you plan to contribute to the development or make changes to the source code, install `qDNA` in editable mode by cloning its GitHub repository.

### Steps

1. **Clone the GitHub Repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/dehe1011/QuantumDNA.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Cloned Repository**:

    ```bash
    cd QuantumDNA
    ```

3. **Run the Activation Script**:
    Use the provided activation script to complete the installation. Instructions vary by platform (see below).
