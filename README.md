# QuantumDNA

**Author: [Dennis Herb](https://github.com/dehe1011)**

This Python package can be cited as:

> *QuantumDNA (github.com/dehe1011/QuantumDNA)*, D. Herb, 2024, DOI: [10.5281/zenodo.12734027](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12734027)

## Introduction

Welcome to QuantumDNA, a powerful and flexible tool designed to calculate lifetimes, average charge separation, and dipole moments of excited states along DNA. Leveraging the formalism of open quantum systems and based on tight-binding Hamiltonians, QuantumDNA is equipped to handle various tight-binding models. Users can incorporate custom tight-binding parameters from ab initio calculations or experimental data, as well as define their own models, making the tool highly adaptable. QuantumDNA is regularly updated to ensure it remains at the cutting edge and includes a user-friendly interface to be accessible even to researchers less familiar with computer science. Results from several research papers can be reproduced with QuantumDNA.

### Key Features

* Versatile Calculations: Calculate lifetimes, charge separation, and dipole moments.
* Customizable Models: Add and use custom tight-binding parameters and models.
* User-Friendly Interface: Designed for ease of use by all researchers.
* Parallelization: Supports parallel computing for the calculation of excited state properties for large ensembles of DNA sequences, optimizing performance within the computationally intensive context of open quantum systems.
* Regular Updates: Stay current with the latest advancements and improvements.

## What's new

* Added a graphical user interface (GUI) to the package such that it is easily accessible for users who are less familiar with computer science. The user interface is based on the [customtkinter](https://customtkinter.tomschimansky.com/) package by Tom Schimansky.
* Added a [documentation](https://quantumdna.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) available on Read the Docs

## Getting started

### Quick Installation

For a quick installation, you can install the `qDNA` package via pip:

```bash
pip install qDNA
```

To ensure compatibility and avoid conflicts with other packages, we recommend using a virtual environment. For detailed installation instructions and alternative methods, please refer to the [Installation Guide](INSTALLATION.md).

### Example Program

To test QuantumDNA, you can run the following simple example where the exciton lifetime and the average charge separation of a double-stranded GCG DNA sequence are calculated. You can try different sequences, tight-binding models, and keyword arguments to investigate how these factors affect the exciton lifetime and average charge separation. For example, you might find that in general more uniform sequences show higher values. Do you know the reason for this observation?

```python

from qDNA import calc_lifetime, calc_dipole

# input
upper_strand = 'GCG'
tb_model_name = 'ELM'
kwargs = dict(unit='rad/ps', relax_rate=3, source='Hawke2010')

# calculation
lifetime = calc_lifetime(upper_strand, tb_model_name, **kwargs)
dipole = calc_dipole(upper_strand, tb_model_name, **kwargs)

# output
print(f"Exciton lifetime {lifetime} fs")
print(f"Average charge separation {dipole} A")
```

## Documentation

The documentation for the [latest release](https://quantumdna.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is available for reading on Read The Docs. Tutorials can be found in a separate GitHub repository [QuantumDNA-notebooks](https://github.com/dehe1011/QuantumDNA-notebooks)

## Graphical User Interface

The `qDNA` package includes a graphical user interface (GUI) that provides an intuitive and user-friendly way to interact with the package's functionalities. You can access the GUI with the following code:

```python

from qDNA.gui import qDNA_app

app = qDNA_app()
app.mainloop()
```

The GUI allows you to easily explore and utilize the capabilities of the `qDNA` package. Below are some examples demonstrating its use:

* **Menu Window:** Access various functionalities from a centralized menu.

<blockquote><em>Screenshot of the menu of the user interface.</em></blockquote>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Plot Generation:</strong> Create plots effortlessly by submitting your parameters through the GUI.</li>
</ul>

</p>
<blockquote><em>Plot obtained after pressing the submit button on the menu (see image above).</em></blockquote>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Calculation Display:</strong> Perform calculations, such as exciton lifetime and average charge separation, and view the results directly within the interface.</li>
</ul>

<p align="center">

The GUI streamlines the process of working with `qDNA`, making it accessible even to those who may not be familiar with coding. Whether you're generating plots or calculating complex dynamics, the GUI provides a convenient and efficient way to achieve your goals.
